<h2>Hey, nice to meet you!</h2>

<div class="left">
  <p>
    I'm <strong>Feross Aboukhadijeh</strong> &lt;<a href="mailto:feross@feross.org">feross@feross.org</a>&gt;. I'm a web developer, designer, computer security researcher, teacher, long distance runner, gamer, and music lover.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm <span id="ageInYears"></span> years old<span id="ageInDays">.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    I specialize in web development &mdash; specifically, high-level programming languages, browsers, and web framework design. I'm also fascinated by the human brain, psychology, online education, the quantified self movement, and (more recently) augmented reality, and wearable computers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a BS in computer science from <a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> and I'm working towards my MS.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the past, I've worked at <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a>. I've also done some research in the Stanford <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/">human-computer interaction</a> and <a href="http://seclab.stanford.edu/">computer security</a> labs.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Stanford, I spent 5 quarters teaching computer science to new CS students in Stanford's <a href="http://cs198.stanford.edu">CS 198</a> program, and I organized lots of sweet computing-related events as president of Stanford's <a href="http://stanfordacm.com">Association for Computing Machinery</a> chapter.
  </p>
  <p>
    In September 2010, I built <a href="http://ytinstant.com">YouTube Instant</a> (a really fast way to search YouTube) in just 3 hours as a bet with my roommate. The site garnered immediate worldwide media attention &mdash; 1 million visitors in 10 days, and hundreds of news stories. Chad Hurley, CEO and co-founder of YouTube, was so impressed that he immediately offered me a job at YouTube (which I had to turn down in order to finish my degree).
  </p>
  <p>My <a href="/resume/">resume</a> is also available. I currently live in Mountain View, CA.</p>
