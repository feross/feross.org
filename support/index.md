# Buy a Support Contract

I'm <strong>Feross</strong>, a prolific open source author and maintainer.

I maintain <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~feross">100+ packages on npm</a></strong> which are <strong>downloaded 100+ million times per month</strong>. All my code is freely accessible on <a href="https://github.com/feross">GitHub</a> and funded by <a href="/thanks/">my supporters</a>.

I now offer an open source support contract, for companies and teams who want dedicated support, advice, and direct assistance with JavaScript, Node.js, P2P, security, or other open source issues.

If you want to chat about getting a support contract for your company or team, email me at <a href="mailto:">[my first name]@feross.org</a>.
