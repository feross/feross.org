# Get a Support Contract

Does your company or team need dedicated support, advice, and direct assistance with JavaScript, Node.js, security, or open source issues?

I'm Feross, a prolific open source author. I maintain <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~feross">100+ open source packages</a> which are downloaded 500+ million times per month. All my work is [freely available](https://github.com/feross) on GitHub.

I specialize in making computers (and especially browsers) do things they’re not supposed to do. Bring me your trickiest, most difficult challenges and I’ll help solve them. I'm an expert in JavaScript, Node.js, security, computer networking, WebRTC, P2P, browser APIs, and open source.

I offer **support contracts** and **one hour consultations** to help solve your problems.

## Support Contract

- **48 hours of consulting services per year** (development, support, etc.)
- **Email support** for any JavaScript, Node.js, or open source issue
- **Large company logo** and link on the official website and readme of [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com) or [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io), and [feross.org/thanks](/thanks/), which get 180K page views per month
- **Priority GitHub issues**, so your issues are addressed first
- Thank you tweet from [@feross](https://twitter.com/feross) Twitter account
- **$3,000 per month**

**At this time, I have no availability for clients.**.
