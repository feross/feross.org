Today, I'm releasing the source code for a couple of my past projects.

## The projects

* **[Instant.fm](http://instant.fm)**, a music playlist sharing service. [[github](https://github.com/feross/Instant.fm)]
* **Fling**, a way to send songs, videos, and urls from your phone to your desktop computer by flicking your wrist. [[github](https://github.com/feross/Fling)]

I released the code for these projects a while ago but never posted about it:

* **[CMSploit](/cmsploit/)**, a security scanner to find temporary config files that contain passwords on public websites. [[github](https://github.com/feross/CMSploit)]
* **WireSheep**, shows you each user on the network and all the HTTP requests they're making. [[github](https://github.com/feross/WireSheep)]
* **[Selective Attention Test](https://feross.org/hacks/selective-attention-test/)**, a new version of the famous [gorilla video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo). [[github](https://github.com/feross/Selective-Attention-Test)]

## Your turn!

Release some of your own code! All the cool kids are doing it. Happy hacking!
