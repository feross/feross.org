title: How Many Feross's Can Fit in One URL?
---

I decided to figure out how many times I could fit my name "Feross" in one URL, with each "Feross" serving a different function. Here is my result:

**[http://feross.feross.org/feross/feross.feross?feross=feross#feross](http://feross.feross.org/feross/feross.feross?feross=feross#feross)**

If you remove a single "feross" from the URL, then you fail and don't get to see the secret stuff hidden at this location!

## Can you name all the feross's?

Every one serves a different function in the URL.

In order, they are:

- subdomain
- domain name
- TLD - top level domain (technically, there isn't a .feross ...yet!)
- folder
- file name
- file extension
- "get" parameter
- "get" value
- URL anchor (or hash)

Yay for procrastination! Ok, back to studying for finals!
