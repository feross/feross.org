I want to thank all the people who voted for me -- I feel so honored and humbled by all the attention. I'll do my best to keep making cool stuff that delights people.

Also, I want to thank the good people at [.Net Magazine](http://www.netmagazine.com/) for putting on this awesome award series to recognize so many of the creative people who work in web design and development.
