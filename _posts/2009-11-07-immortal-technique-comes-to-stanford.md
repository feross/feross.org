title: Immortal Technique Comes to Stanford
---

Second famous rapper I've met this week: [Immortal Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Technique) -- most famous for his political activism and political rap music. This guys's a ***real*** [rapper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapper) (unlike [Chamillionaire](/ridin-dirty-at-stanford/), who is a commercial hip-hop <s>artist</s> sellout).

**Immortal Technique** is legit -- he's turned down *half-million dollar *offers to sign to major music labels like **Sony** and **Def Jam** because he doesn't want to lose control over the content of his music. He's often criticized for the content of his music (listen to some and you'll see why), but there's more than a grain of truth to what he raps about.

I don't have time right now to write a long blog post (I have 2 CS assignments due soon, 1 test on Monday, and 20 CS assignments to grade), so I'll leave it at that. But, I encourage you to take a look at Technique if you haven't heard of him before -- he's quite interesting.
