There is a ***surprising amount*** of wisdom to be gleaned from **bumper stickers** (you know, those rectangular stickers people like to [plaster all over their cars](/images/bumper-sticker-car.jpg) :-)). Most bumper stickers are meant to support this or the other politician, so they're not that memorable.

But occasionally, I stumble on a particularly **humorous** or **profound** bumper sticker. So, a while ago I decided to start **writing down** the cool bumper sticker slogans I stumble upon.

## This is that list, posted here for your amusement and pondering:

> "Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth." -- Albert Einstein

> If I give up all my freedom, **THEN** I'll be safe.

> How is a nation divided when the candidates agree?

> Whatever stupid shit you believe, SPEAK UP!

> If you still think they hate us because we are free, perhaps you should read instead of watching TV.

> War is Peace.  Freedom is Slavery.  Ignorance is Strength.

> DON'T STEAL: The government hates competition.

## Liberty Stickers

If you like these ones, the folks over at [Liberty Stickers](http://www.libertystickers.com/) have some pretty good stickers too:

> "If there is sin superior to every other, it is that of willfull and offensive war." -- Thomas Paine

> People aren't human if they live across water from here.

> "War is a way of shattering to pieces materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and intelligent." -- George Orwell.

> "Every election is a sort of advance sale of stolen goods." -- H.L. Mencken

> "If tyranny and oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy." -- James Madison

> "A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government." -- Edward Abbey

> "1 death is a tragedy. 1,000,000 is a statistic." -- Joe Stalin

> "Every decent man is ashamed of the government he lives under." -- H.L. Mencken

> "All murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets." -- Voltaire

> "What good fortune for governments that the people do not think." -- Adolf Hitler

> "We know that dictators are quick to choose aggression, while free nations strive to resolve differences in peace." -- George W. Bush

> "We must guard against the unwarranted influence by the [Military-industrial Complex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military-industrial_complex)." -- Dwight D. Eisenhower

> "War is terrorism, magnified a hundred times." -- Howard Zinn, historian

> Even though everything I've ever heard any politician say about anything has been a damn lie, the next time they start making up excuses to start a war, I'll believe them then too. Because I'm an American. United I stand!

> Government: Causing more violence than it prevents since 10,000 B.C.

> Government is Dangerous: Brought to you by the 175 million people murdered by their own governments in the last century.

> Neutrality: Our only path to peace.

### And my favorite bumper sticker of all:

> Dear I.R.S.: Please remove me from your mailing list. :-)

Hopefully, you've noticed the common threads in all of these slogans (they're stuff I'm always talking/preaching/ranting about):

1. Don't believe everything you are told
2. Fight tyranny
3. Strive for peace
4. And most important of all: **Question authority!**
