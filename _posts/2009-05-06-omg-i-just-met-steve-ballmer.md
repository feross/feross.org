In a really cool turn of events, I just got to shake hands with Steve Ballmer!

Even cooler, he is wearing [my t-shirt design](/stanford-entrepreneurs-nike-t-shirt-just-start-up/)! Who knew that my fashion sense would be on the body of a dude worth 11 billion dollars?

## An adventure in sneaking backstage

After Steve finished his one-hour talk in Memorial Auditorium at Stanford, he went backstage to meet with some reporters and say goodbye to the people who invited him to speak at Stanford.

I wanted to say hi, so I hopped up onto the stage and walked right up to the room he was in. A guard at the door blocked me from entering, and I thought that I wasn't going to get to say hi.

But, right then, Steve walked through the door -- he was right it front of me! So, I just said "Hey Steve. I designed the shirt you're wearing -- can I get a picture?"

Lots of others wanted a pic too, but he left to catch a flight right after take the picture with me.
