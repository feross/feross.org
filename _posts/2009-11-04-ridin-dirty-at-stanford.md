I just saw **Chamillionaire** and **Quincy Jones III **talk about entrepreneurship at **Stanford**!

**Chamillionaire** is most famous for his single [Ridin' Dirty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8-UiXotuXE) and the Weird Al [parody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEzGIuY7kw) that followed it. Unfortunately, he didn't rap for us -- instead, he gave us a bit of hustlin advice. Ahhhh YEEEAH...

My favorite part of the event was when Stanford president [John Hennessey](http://www.stanford.edu/dept/president/biography/) asked the audience "How can we change the world?" and someone in the audience yelled ***"By ridin' dirty!"*** Anonymity for the win.

## Quotes

Here are the most amusing things that Chamillionaire said at the event:

> All the other rappers called me a nerd for using the Internet. (on promoting his music online)

> I hope that someone in this room wins the Entrepreneurship Innovation Contest ...so then I can steal their idea. (Chamillionaire's idea of motivational advice)

> My job was a lot easier before I was a boss. (on becoming a manager)

> Why would I want to sell something with my face? I wouldn't even wear something with my face. (on selling merchandise)

> It's crazy... I'm in the business of making money.

And one from Quincy Jones III:

> eHustling is available to everybody (on the power of YouTube as a way to go directly to customers)
