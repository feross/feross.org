Last Tuesday, I got to hang out with "the world's 579th greatest rapper," [MC Frontalot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Frontalot). He is best-known for coining the term [nerdcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerdcore_hip_hop) and basically defining the whole *nerdcore hip-hop* musical genre. As you can tell by picture above, I dressed appropriately for the occasion. ;-)

When a visiting grad student told me about his plans to host an MC Frontalot concert at Stanford, I was ecstatic! I pledged some money of behalf of my club, the [Stanford ACM](http://stanfordacm.com), to help pay for the concert costs. Nerdcore culture is computer science related, *right?*

A bunch of other Stanford clubs also made contributions, including the IEEE, GSPB, CCRMA, Audio Engineering Society, and Hip Hop Congress.

MC Frontalot is the nerdcorest of the core. Just a sampling:

> We deliver the hits that give the kids with the spectacles spectacular fits!
> I seen one nerd foam at the mouth in his glee.
> (It was me, in the mirror, rhyming, brushing my teeth.)
> And now the heezy we’s off don’t babble 300 baud.
> I get no error while compiling my rhyme.
