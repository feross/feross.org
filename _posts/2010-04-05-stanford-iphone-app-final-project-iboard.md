This is the iPhone app that I'm  working on with my friend John Hiesey. iBoard is a networked drawing app that allows multiple users from around the world to draw together on  the same drawing canvas in real-time. Use it to share your ideas -- diagram, brainstorm, sketch, or doodle with your friends from around the  world in real-time.

The video is from the final project presentations for the Stanford course [CS193P: iPhone Programming](http://cs193p.stanford.edu). Before our demo, our iPod touch was accidentally disconnected from the server, so it caused a hiccup in our demo -- but we still proved that it works using the iPhone simulators on our Macbook Pros.

Also, the name *iBoard* is likely to change before we put it on the App Store. **Please share your comments and feedback!**

## Update

Sadly, we never got around to putting this on the App Store, but I hope to release the code eventually.
