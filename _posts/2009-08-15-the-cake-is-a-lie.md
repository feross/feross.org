Last weekend, I finished playing [Portal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_%28video_game%29) for the third time. After the third play, the game still amazes me. My respect for [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/) has only grown as I play more of their games.

From my humble FPS beginnings when I first played **Half Life**, **Counter Strike**, and **Day of Defeat** in sixth grade, I continue to enjoy Valve's games immensely.

After buying the [Orange Box](http://orange.half-life2.com/) on [Steam](http://www.steampowered.com) last year and playing all of Valve's latest Source-engine based games **Half Life 2**, **Team Fortress 2**, and **Portal**, I'm even more impressed with the polish, attention to detail, and fun-ness of their games!

Now, all I need to do is find some time to play their latest game, **Left for Dead 2** -- but, that will have to wait until I'm finished with the rest of the Half Life 2 games (episode 1 and 2)!
