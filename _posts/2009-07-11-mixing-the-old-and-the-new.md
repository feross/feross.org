title: Mixing the Old and the New
---

What is it about old stuff that makes us get nostalgic when we look at it?

I get nostalgic about lots of stuff -- even stuff which was created before my time. Like this **Lear-Siegler ADM-3A terminal**, for example. Doesn't just looking it at it make you miss the **clickity-clackity keys** of the old keyboards and the **green hue** of the computer terminal?

Or what about the classic **Nintendo Entertainment System**? I remember playing this machine for the first time at my uncle and aunt's house when I was probably 6 years old. I remember being amazed at the** lush 8-bit graphics** and amazing **beeps and boops** the games made.

And sometimes, I even start to miss the** sumptuous computing experience** that was** Windows 3.1**. This was the first non command line operating system I ever used. Just look at it -- doesn't it make you pine for the days gone by when the **Clock application** could be considered a "feature" of an operating system?

Has Minesweeper really not changed since 1992?

## Combining the Old with the New

But nothing brings me more joy than when I see someone** combine the old with the new** -- honoring the past but yet improving on it at the same time. It's like saying, "Yes, you [nostalgic item] were really cool, and in order to give you props for your awesomeness, we are going to attempt to make something **even more awesome**. Most of the time this doesn't succeed, but sometimes it does.

Here are a few of my favorite combinations of old and new.

### 1. The classic song "Singin' In the Rain" from the hit 1952 musical + robots that can break dance.
